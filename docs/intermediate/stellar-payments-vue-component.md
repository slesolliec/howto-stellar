# Vue component that displays list of last payments to a specific address on the Stellar Network

Here is the code for a Vue component that will display the last incomming payments sent to the address passed in the attribute.

Once you've registered your component in your Vue application, simply call it with:

```MarkDown
<Stellar-payments account="GD24ZNCKDYYKWDCHN77W6IZMYRCTBODLSJBQ4WJBIXVPYFJB66IGHOW2"/>
```

If you are using VuePress (like this site is), simply add that component in /docs/.vuepress/components/Stellar-payments.vue

<<< @/docs/.vuepress/components/Stellar-payments.vue


<Footer/>
<Stellar-payments account="GD24ZNCKDYYKWDCHN77W6IZMYRCTBODLSJBQ4WJBIXVPYFJB66IGHOW2"/>
