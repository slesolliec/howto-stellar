# How to create tokens on Stellar Network?

There are two kinds of tokens that you can create on the Stellar Network. Fungible and non-fungible.

Fungible tokens are used to represent points in a fidelity system, or shares in a project, or currencies. They are really easy to create on Stellar and you will learn how to do that with JavaScript in the [How to create an ICO on Stellar blockchain with JavaScript](ICO-with-Stellar-and-JavaScript).

Non-Fungible tokens are used to represent objects that are unique (like a car, a flat, a card in a collectible game, ...). They are a bit more complicated to set up on Stellar than fungible tokens. You can learn that on [How to implement NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens) with Stellar and JavaScript](../advanced/NFT-Stellar-Non-Fungible-Token).
