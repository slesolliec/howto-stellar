# How to create an ICO on Stellar blockchain with JavaScript

This article will show you how to launch an ICO on the Stellar Network. You will find that it is very easy, and by publishing some information attached to your new token, you will instantly get some built-in extra features of the Stellar Network: you're token will be immediatly tradable on the Stellar DEX = the Stellar Decentralised Exchange.

This article particularly talks about ICOs, but more broadly, it's just the same with any sort of fungible tokens (Tokens like the ERC-20 Ethereum tokens).

## How much does it cost?

Good question. The answer: about 0.001 XLM is operation costs (for sending the transactions to the Stellar Network), and 2.5 XLM in minimal balance holds, because you will normaly need 2 accounts and 1 trustline between the two.

Yep, no more than 3 XLM and you will have your ICO launched on Stellar with DEX integration from day one.

## Now down to the code

This page is a WIP. I'll write it properly ASAP.
