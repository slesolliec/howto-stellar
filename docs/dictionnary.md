<dl>
<dt>Asset</dt>
<dd>Assets on Stellar are defined by an up to 12 character long name, and the account of the issuer of the asset.</dd>

<dt>ICO</dt>
<dd>Initial Coin Offering. It's like an IPO but on a blockchain. Not particularly a Stellar term.</dd>

<dt>Key pair</dt>
<dd>A public key and it's matching private key.</dd>

<dt>Lumen<dt>
<dd>A Lumen is a XLM. It's the native currency on Stellar. (Like Ether for Ethereum, or ADA for Cardano)</dd>

<dt>Public Key</dt>
<dd>It's the one that starts with G... . Share it with anyone. It's you're Stellar account address.</dd>

<dt>Secret Key</dt>
<dd>It's the one that starts with S... . Never share it with anyone. If compromised, anybody can access your account. Never loose it. You can find back your pubkey from your secret key, but you cannot find back your secret key from the public key.</dd>

<dt>Stroop</dt>
<dd>A Stroop is the smallest subdibision of an XLM. It's so small I don't even remember how many zeros I should put: 1 stroop = 0.000001 XLM</dd>

<dt>Token</dt>
<dd>Can be a lot of things ...</dd>

<dt>Transaction</dt>
<dd>A bunch of operations that are sent to the Stellar Network to act on the blockchain. A single transaction may contain up to 100 operations. Each transaction must be cryptographically signed to be accepted. That is what you secred key is for: signing transactions so that they are accepted by the Stellar network.</dd>

<dt>Trustline</dt>
<dd>Some kind of link between an accounts and an asset, that states that: "me account A, I trust the asset B". Each trustline increases the minimum balance by 0.50 XLM, because the trustline not only store the amount of that asset that you have, but also all your buying and selling liabilities to that asset.</dd>
